# Tableau Homework - Citi Bike Analytics

## Background

![Citi-Bikes](Images/bike.jpeg)

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

## Task

**The task in this assignment is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.** 

**Design 2-5 visualizations for each discovered phenomena (4-10 total). The work is over a timespan of MAY 2019 to MAY 2020.** 

**The following are some of the questions answered for this time period.**

* How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?
* By what percentage has total ridership grown?
* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?
* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?
* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, it is clear they are located near major transit hubs)
* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, it is clear they are located near major transit hubs)
* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)
* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?
* Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?
* How does the average trip duration change by age?
* What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?
* Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan?
* How variable is the utilization by bike ID?

**Next...**

* Dashboards for each phenomena were designed and shown below
* The dashboards should be accompanied with an analysis explaining why the phenomena may be occuring. 

**City officials would also like to see one of the following visualizations:**

* **Basic:** A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.

* **Advanced:** A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year). Again, with zip code data overlaid on the map.

* The map you choose should also be accompanied by a write-up unveiling any trends that were noticed during your analysis.

**Tableau Story**

* The Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.
* Care was taken to  make it professional, logical, and visually appealing.

## Notes
### Data Cleaning and Assumptions
The data repository for CitiBikes is massive and quicky runs into the millions of records.  As the past 12 months of data is likely the most representative, this analysis focuses on that time frame.  However, the jupyter notebook in this repo could be easily modified to change the data request to get data for other years or juristrictions. 

I used curl to grab all the .zip files from the web page and unzipped them and concatenated them into one big .csv file. 

```python
!curl -O "https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/2019[05-12]-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip"
!unzip '*.zip'
!rm *.zip
```

Upon inspecting that file many things became apparent and so the following logic was applied to "clean" the data. 

Any rider over the age of 70 was removed.  

Any trip duration less than 90 seconds with the same start and stop station was removed under the assumption that riders realized something wrong with the bike and returned it immediately. 

Any trip duration greater than 2 hours was removed under the assumption that people would not ride the bikes that far and it could be assumed stolen/unreturned. 

This still left 20884381 rows. I used a random sample of five million point to conduct the analysis and generate the visualizations shown in the Tableau file. All Files are availalble in this repo.
